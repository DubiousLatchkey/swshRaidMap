# swshRaidMap
Made for shiny dex completion.  Allows quick filtering of raids by species displaying stars and version.

My intention was to combine the best parts of Pokedens (den details and filtering) with the best parts of Poke Atlas (immersive maps and accurate positioning) and then add onto it.
